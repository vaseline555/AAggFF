## TL; DR
<u>The server-side sequential decision-making</u> framework for the performance uniformity in practical federated settings by constructing <u>adaptive mixing coefficients</u> used to aggregate local updates.
* See also <i>Agnostic Federated Learning</i> ([AFL](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.00146) &ndash; ICML`19) (i.e., min-max optimization; distributionally-robust optimization) &mdash; 𝙰𝙰𝚐𝚐𝙵𝙵 can be regarded as a rectified version of AFL.
* See also <i>Tiltied Empirical Risk minimization</i> ([TERM](https://openreview.net/forum?id=K5YasWXZT3O) &ndash; ICLR`21) &mdash; 𝙰𝙰𝚐𝚐𝙵𝙵 can be viewed as an online version of TERM.


## Reproduce Experiments
#### Setup 
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
> Implemented with: ( Ubuntu 20.04 LTS | Python 3.10.3 | CUDA 11.4 | cuDNN 8.3.2 )


#### Run
```
# to see all arguments
python main.py -h

# e.g., cross-silo setting
sh commands/cross_silo/berka/main_berka.sh
...

# e.g., cross-device setting
sh commands/cross_device/celeba/main_celeba.sh
...
```
> Don't worry, all the data will be downloaded automatically in the specifid path.

## Essence
* See `./server/aaggffserver.py` with comments.
* You may change the decision loss, different OCO framework (or `bandits`, or even `reinforcement learning` setting).
> If you find any interesting directions, please drop me a line for collaboration!
